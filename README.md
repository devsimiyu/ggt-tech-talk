# GGT Components

- Tech Talk at Griffin Global Tech on building a shared UI library using Angular Elements.
- Angular Elements packages Angular components as Web Components, which is a web standard for defining custom HTML elements.

### Build

- Run `npm install` to download the necessary node modules.
- For demonstration purposes, this project contains two sample Angular components packaged as Web Components: `ggt-button` and `ggt-theme`.
- Package the sample Angular components using the `npm run package` command.

### Run

- Once the `npm run package` command completes, the sample Web Components will be ready for use.
- At the root of the project, there's an `index.html` file that can be opened in a browser to display the sample Web Components.
